        How We Share Information
    </p>
    <p>
        We provide you with a platform to post information about yourself to maximize your career opportunities. The information we gather may be shared with the following categories of third parties:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Appolizer Inc</li>
        <li>Employers, when you make your resume searchable or apply to a job</li>
        <li>Other third parties where required by law;</li>
        <li>Other third parties when you give your consent to such sharing such as for resume writing services;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By applying to a job, providing your contact information to show interest in a job, or by replying to a message from an employer, you consent to the disclosure of your information to that employer and to be contacted by such employer for employment related purposes.</p>
    <p>We do not share contact information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. We also share information in the following ways:</p>
    <p class="ml-2">1. We share your information with our service providers, which are third parties who help deliver our products and services to you. Examples of these services include hosting our web servers and site databases, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer management tools, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not use that data for any other purpose. We will remain responsible for any information shared in this way.</p>
    <p class="ml-2">2. We disclose information to third parties when you give your consent for us to do so. For example:</p>
    <p class="ml-3">(a) if you make your resume searchable or if we collect information you’ve made available on a public website then all parties with access to our resume or profile database products will have access to your information;</p>
    <p class="ml-3">(b) if you opt in to receive information about the products or services of third parties, we supply your contact information to those third parties so they may contact you.
        We also share aggregated information (including location data) about Appolizer Inc. site visitors and application users with third parties to serve advertisements to you online. We also aggregate data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job search. This aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or shared publicly. If we create a co-branded site with another company, information collected on that site will be retained by both companies and subject to the privacy policies of both companies which will be published on the co-branded sites.</p>
    <p class="ml-2">3. We may disclose to third parties information that we have collected from other websites.</p>
    <p class="ml-2">4. We disclose information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith – after considering your privacy interests and other factors – that such action is necessary to: (a) meet legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) investigate fraud, prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.</p>
    <p class="ml-2">5. We may disclose and transfer personal information to a third party who acquires any or all of Appolizer Inc.’s business units, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Appolizer Inc. becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding, such information will be disposed of in a transaction approved by the court. You will be notified of the sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party by email or through a prominent notice posted on the site.</p>
